<h1>CDO Master Server Example</h1>

This project contains the launch configuration "ExampleMasterServer" that
can be used to start a new OSGi process with a CDO master repository.
You may need to update the launch configuration by clicking the "Add Required
Plugins" button on the Plugins tab.
<p>
Before you actually run this master server you should review the server
configuration file /config/cdo-server.xml in this project. In particular
you may want to adjust the following settings:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Acceptor port.
		Default is 2036.
	</li>
	<li>
		H2 datasource URL.
		Default is a /database folder in the current directory, i.e., this project.
	</li>
	<li>
		ID generation location.
		Default is STORE, should be changed to CLIENT for all offline scenarios!
	</li>
</ul>

If the server is running you can point your web browser to
<a href="http://localhost:7777">http://localhost:7777</a> in order to
introspect the repository. Please note that this introspection facility
should not be used in production!
